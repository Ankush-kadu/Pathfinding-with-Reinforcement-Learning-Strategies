# Pathfinding-with-Reinforcement-Learning-Strategies

## Overview
This repository showcases my exploration in reinforcement learning, focusing on Q-Learning and Deep Q-Networks (DQN). The project involves path planning and dynamic control using pre-built Gym environments and a custom 4x4 grid environment.

## Key Features
- **Q-Learning Exploration:**
  - Implemented on Gym's Frozen Lake for path planning insights.

- **DQN Implementation:**
  - Applied on the pre-built Cart and Pole environment for mastering dynamic control nuances.

- **Custom Environment Creation:**
  - Crafted a tailored 4x4 grid environment for path planning, including initial and goal positions and obstacles.

- **Algorithm Comparison:**
  - Utilized both Q-Learning and DQN for path planning in the custom environment, meticulously comparing and analyzing results.

- **Robust Testing:**
  - Rigorously tested the algorithms with varying initial, obstacle, and goal positions, demonstrating versatility and efficacy.
